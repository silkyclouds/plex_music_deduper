## üìñ Overview

When your Plex music library grows, it‚Äôs easy to end up with multiple editions of the same album scattered across your filesystem. **Plex Music Deduper** automates:

- **Selecting** the highest-quality, most complete edition  
- **Merging** any unique bonus tracks into that edition  
- **Moving** all losing editions into a configurable ‚Äúdupes‚Äù folder (with rollback support)  
- **Triggering** Plex to rescan just the affected artist/album path and empty its trash so your UI updates immediately  

End result: exactly one version of each album in Plex, with no lost tracks.

## üîß Configuration

Edit the top of `plex_music_deduper.py` to match your setup:

```python
# Path to Plex‚Äôs SQLite library DB (read-only)
PLEX_DB_FILE = "/path/to/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Plug-in Support/Databases/com.plexapp.plugins.library.db"

# Your Plex HTTP host & token
PLEX_HOST  = "http://YOUR_PLEX_IP:32400"
PLEX_TOKEN = "YOUR_PLEX_TOKEN"

# Numeric ID of your Plex ‚ÄúMusic‚Äù library section
SECTION_ID = 1

# Map Plex container prefixes ‚Üí real host paths
# If Plex runs in Docker, map each container path to where it lives on the host:
PATH_MAP = {
    "/music/compilations": "/mnt/music/Compilations",
    "/music/matched":      "/mnt/music/Music_matched",
    "/music/unmatched":    "/mnt/music/Music_dump",
    "/music/dupes":        "/mnt/music/Music_dupes/Plex_dupes",
    "/music/other":        "/mnt/music/OtherSource",
}
# If Plex runs on the same host, you can use identity mapping:
# PATH_MAP = {"/": "/"}

# Where to drop losing editions
DUPE_ROOT = Path(PATH_MAP["/music/dupes"])
```
